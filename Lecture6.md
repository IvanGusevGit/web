# Spring Framework

**Spring Boot** - framework for configuration of spring framework
All configurations are provided by standard and it is better to use it as it is and do not try to change this. This configurations are well organised and very suitable and efficient for usage.

Spring controls the lifetime of huge amount functional objects. As a result we won't code `new` many times. We won't create many instances. All them will be pushed from outside and will be managed by spring. Sometimes we will create dependencies by marking constructors is specific way.
